----------------------Understand the Problem-----------------------
THINGS TO CONSIDER:
  -If any part of the problem is unclear, ask for clarification.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write a program that manages robot factory settings.

EXPECTED INPUT:

EXPECTED OUTPUT:

EDGE CASES:

RULES (make sure to check for things not explicitly stated):
  - When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name. The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated, such as RX837 or BC811.
  - If a robot is reset that means their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will respond with a new random name.
  - The names must be random; they should not follow a predictable sequence. Random names means there is a risk of collisions. Your solution should not allow the use of the same name twice when avoidable.
  - You must install the NPM package named seedrandom for  tests.
